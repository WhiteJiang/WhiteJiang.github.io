## About me

Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Nanjing University of Science and Technology in [Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG)](https://imag-njust.net/), supervised by Prof. [Jinhui Tang](http://202.119.85.163/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=vXtXlpkb!DG57dx!7t4N7w==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=0890VO2fcm0=)

Now, my research interests include computer vision and pattern recognition, with a focus on deep learning based vehicle/Person re-identification.
