Hi! I am currently a PHD at <a href="https://imag-njust.net/"> Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG)</a>, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University Of Science And Technolog, under the supervision of <a href="https://imag-njust.net/jinhui-tang/">Prof. Jinhui Tang</a> and <a href="https://imag-njust.net/xiangboshu/">Prof. Xiangbo Shu</a>.
My research interests include computer vision and pattern recognition, with a focus on deep learning based vehicle/person re-identification.
Open-source projects can be found at my <a href='https://github.com/muzishen'>[Github]</a>, and publications can be found at <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wqvr28MAAAAJ'>[Google Scholar]</a>.
